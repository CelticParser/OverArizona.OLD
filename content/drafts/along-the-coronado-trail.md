## Introduction

This road is very exciting and sometimes very exposed and unsecured driveway in innumerable twists and turns. It was named after the Spanish explorer Francisco Vasquez de Coronado who explored this area in 1540 on a quest to find the Seven Cities of Cíbola. The highway is the primary route to access [Canyon de Chelly National Monument].

## This infamous road is tightly hairpinned and bumped

As an exquisite winding mountain drive with many sharp and blind curves and hairpin switchbacks leading the traveler over mountains and has little or no shoulders on steep cliffs. The entire road is paved, however, it’s one of the least traveled federal highways. This is a meandering, moseying, slow-motion drive. The 123 miles of pavement between Springerville and Clifton feature 460 curves skirting the eastern edge of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests. Thrilling, scary and dramatic, but speedy it’s not.

This road is usually open all year, but it can be closed anytime when the access is not cleared of snow. Snow is not plowed from the road on weekends or at night in the winter. Be sure and gas up in Alpine. There are no service stations along this stretch of road. This is a good drive at any season of the year. It’s the only up-land road on the district kept open during the winter when it’s plowed between the hours of 8:00 am and 5:00 pm—weekdays only!
