## Introduction 

{{< img-post "" "v1527632778/Dance-Hall-Doors-Blue-Fron-Inn.jpg" "Dance Hall Doors at The Blue Front Inn" "right" >}}

Many years ago, before the current Highway 77 was established, folks traveling through Mammoth had to take Main St. through the heart of town on their way to other destinations like Oracle and Tuscon. The Blue Front Inn was a great place to stop for libations and a spot of dancing. It has been closed for many years, although it still sports the beautiful powder blue paint job marking it as a landmark in this Copper Corridor town.

## Near By

These days, Mammoth has transitioned from being a mining bedroom community to a town focused on services, tourism and light industry.

East of Mammoth is the [Galiuro Mountain Wilderness][] within the Madrean Sky Islands region where the infamous [Power's Shootout][] took place. To the northeast is the famous towering cliffs of the [Aravaipa Canyon Wilderness][] with it's flowing water and a rich diversity of flora and fauna. To the west are the [Black Hills of Greenlee County][] and south of Mammoth, aside Highway 77, is [Oracle][] and the ["Back Road" up onto Mt. Lemmon][].

Also a few miles southwest of the dying copper town, is [Biosphere 2][], a completely enclosed 3-acre model of the Earth's ecosystem. The Biosphere was originally built as a completely sealed off and self-sufficient research center but shortly into the experiment, things went awry with the folks sealed inside. Currently, Biosphere 2 is a teaching and learning center with on-going research into how the environment of the Earth is being affected by the presence (and industry) of modern humans. Tours of the Biosphere property are offered daily.
